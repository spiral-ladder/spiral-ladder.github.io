<div class="title"><h1>solving ZK Hack V puzzle 3 </h1><time class="meta" datetime="2024-12-27">Dec 27, 2024</time></div>
<p>I solved my first online ZK Hack puzzle this last season. I didn’t win best writeup, but
my writeup did get featured on the <a href="https://zkhack.dev/zkhackV/puzzleV3.html">puzzle page</a>, so that’s something at least!</p>
<p>Instead of going over my solution in this post, I’ll briefly talk about my experience with Noir and its tooling.
If you’re interested in my writeup, you can find it <a href="https://gist.github.com/spiral-ladder/eb544879e47d3b678cbaf766bf94186e">here</a>.</p>
<section id="Noir:-first-impressions">

<div class="title"><h2>Noir: first impressions </h2></div>
<p>My first impression of Noir from the short puzzle alone is that it’s clean. I haven’t had much experience with writing
Circom but reading it is a pain.</p>
<p>Error messages in Noir are also far more useful compared to in Circom – if being Rust-based has had any positive effect, it would
be the helpfulness of the compiler and the tooling. Speaking of tooling, nargo is great!</p>

<section id="The-not-so-good">

<div class="title"><h2>The not-so-good </h2></div>
<p>Now, the not so good. These are probably just nitpicks at this point because I haven’t had enough experience with the 
language to give a fair criticism, so take these comments with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I think the way inputs get fed into the Noir program doesn’t seem right. Firstly, it’s not super clear that inputs
are implicitly fed from <code>Prover.toml</code>, and secondly (this is more of a nitpick), TOML is a terrible format for such
a purpose.</p>
<p>I think JSON would be more suitable here for a clearer hierarchy of inputs with nesting -
no more awkward <a href="https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables">“table of tables”</a>. Especially for the purpose
of just passing in input to the program, TOML is overkill and is suited for more verbose purposes eg.
configuration like in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. But I guess at least YAML wasn’t chosen here.</p>
<p>Another ‘feature’ I’m cautious about is the fact that it is a Rust-based DSL. Rust looks like Rust because of its
design choices. I don’t think languages should emulate Rust just for the sake of ‘familiar syntax’, to capture
Rust developers in the space. I don’t think this is the sole reason for doing a Rust-based DSL, but it’s definitely one
of the reasons that people often cite as a positive. I’d argue that Rust syntax is overly verbose and ugly.
It only looks that way because of the amount of work that is frontloaded to the compiler.
Especially for circuit development, (I believe) there is no need to be ‘Rust-like’ at all, unless you’re reinventing
rustc, except this time for circuit compilation.</p>
<p>That said I don’t have too much else to say atm. I will have to write more Noir before I figure if I
like it enough or not.</p>
